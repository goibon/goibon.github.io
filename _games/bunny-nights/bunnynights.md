#Summary
A rhythm game developed for Android during my semester at DADIU. The game is set in the 80's in a world of anthropomorphic bunnies where the playey takes on the role of Shawn who is looking to impress the bunny ladies with his dance moves. The player must tap the buttons as they appear on the screen in sync with the original tracks that play in the levels. If the player succeeds, Shawn will get the lady, otherwise he will have to go home alone tonight.

#Development
The game was developed by Team 4 of DADIU (The National Academy of Digital Interactive Entertainment) 2014 in the period September 8th through September 17th. The following conditions for the game were set by DADIU for the students to follow:

##Conditions for Content:
- The game can be of any genre.
- The game must be playable as a single-player game.
- The game must be controlled by one finger only using a one-touch control scheme.That means only simple interactions like ‘Tap’ and ‘Tap and Hold’ are allowed. No multi-touch, dragging, pinching, virtual joystick, shake, sound or other advanced controls.
- The game must present itself in Danish and an English version involving a technical and practical solution to handle translations.

##Technical Conditions:
- The game must be developed in Unity.
- The game must be playable on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1. This means that you will have to consider load times and asset sizes, when you plan your production.
- The game should be completed in the sense that it is optimised and can be played by others with no extra information.
