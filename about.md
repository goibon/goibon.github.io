My name is Kasper Lind SÃ¸rensen and I'm currently getting my masters degree in computer science at Aalborg University (AAU) in Aalborg, Denmark.
I have a bachelor's degree in Software and I've spent a semester at the [National Academy of Digital Interactive Entertainment][DADIU] as lead programmer for a team of 18 people creating two mobile games for Android:
